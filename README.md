# ZenDBShell
A lightweight DBMS built with Bash and Zenity, providing a simple graphical interface for database creation, management, and queries—all from your terminal with GUI dialogs.  If you want, I can also draft a longer, more engaging README intro that will make your repo stand out. Do you want me to do that?
